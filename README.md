# Rust Trading Card Game

## Background
I started this project to help myself learn Rust through application. I have always enjoyed Trading Card Games, such as Magic The Gathering and Slay the Spire, both of which have influenced the way that I think about this project. Eventually, I would like to turn this into a real time card battler in the vein of Lost Kingdoms by From Software.
